Inheritance:
Single inheritance--> class Parent{public: };
                      class child : public Parent{};
		also possible :
			    class child : public Parent,Neighbour{}; 
                                     [Neighbour is another class]



Polymorphism
     1 Complile time : Function overloading ; Operator overloading : not possible on { (.) (.*) (::) (?:) }

     2 Run time : overriding ==> Virtual class


Virtual: is used to make imaginary part for compiler
         in overriding always base or parent class is executed then the derived one
